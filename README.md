With this being my first project in my journey as a web developer. I am just looking to use everything that I have learned so far in HTML.

I believe that I have exhausted all of the commands that were taught to me and I have made use of them with my limited knowledge.

Some things that I would like to improve would be the creativitiy of my usage. Such as, making use of the different file formats like GIFs and PNGs to make it more pleasing to the eye. 

In the coding side, I'd improve on making my code cleaner and more consistent.
